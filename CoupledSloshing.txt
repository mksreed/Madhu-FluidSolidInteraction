[MUSIC] Well. You know that the free surface is
going to bring you some stiffness to the fluid dynamics, and therefore there
is the possibility of sloshing modes. We obtained the first mode for
a rectangular tank and we said that we are going to use it to represent
the whole sloshing dynamics of the fluid. That is a bit of an oversimplification,
but we want simple models to understand
the mechanisms of the interactions. Here is the problem I want to solve. The dynamics of a tank containing
sloshing fluid and elastically supported. So this is going to be some
combination of the sloshing motion that I've just analyzed and
that of a simple mass spring system, the mass of the tank
connected to a spring. How can I solve this? My fluid system on the left
is defined by capital Q of t, which satisfies MF capital Q double
dot plus KF  capital Q equals zero. And the solid system on the right
is defined by q(t) which satisfied q double dot plus q equals zero. Actually, I know how to
solve some coupling. When I did not consider sloshing, I found
 how  a  fluid was coupled to a moving solid. That was the issue of added mass,
remember. In that particular case,
the added mass problem is simple. The fluid just moves with a solid. The added mass is the  mass of fluid. So the pressure shape is  just minus x, the velocity shape is
the pure translation. It is identical to the solid mode shape. And the added mass is just the fluid mass,
so here the mass number over two. [MUSIC] First I would like to model the effect
of solid motion on sloshing, just like 
in my glass of wine when I moved it. Let us try building a combined
solution using the added mass  case and the  simple sloshing mode. Here it is, p equals capital Q double dot,
capital Phi p, this is the sloshing part, plus Q double
dot Phi p, this is the added mass part. This solution satisfies the boundary
condition on the sides and at the bottom. Now, on the free surface,
I can do exactly as before, writing the free surface
condition in a projected form. I write that the free
surface quantity times phip summed over the whole
free surface equals zero. By inserting the combined
form of p into this, I get terms relative to capital Q and
terms relative to q. What are they? Those related to capital Q and its time derivatives
are exactly those I got before. The sloshing modal mass, MF, and
the sloshing modal stiffness, KF. But now, I have a new term that
combines phi p and capital Phi p. So to summarize,
by using a combined solution based on the pure sloshing solution
plus the added mass solution, I obtain the equation governing
the dynamics of sloshing as the classical modal oscillator equation, with the modal mass MF and
the modal stiffness KF, forced by the acceleration of the solid,
q double dot. The coefficient, which I call
the solid to fluid coupling mass, can be computed with the pressure
shapes of the sloshing and of the added mass  solutions. In our problem,
I get mSF equals two over pi squared. This is why wine sloshes in my glass,
because I accelerate the glass. Now reversely,
let us see what is going to be the effect of the motion of the fluid on
the dynamics of the solid. This is the issue of
the truck overturning. It is the sum on all the interface
of the pressure force minus pn It is the sum on all the interface
of the pressure force minus pn ������ scalar product with  the shape of motion phi. Now, because my pressure here
is the sum of two parts, I get two parts in my loading. One is a coefficient times
capital Q double dot The other one a coefficient
times q double dot. The second one is easy to identify. It is the fluid loading caused
by my added mass solution, so it is the added mass effect. The first one gives the effect
of the sloshing itself. It is the fluid to solid coupling mass. Let us summarize. The dynamics of this fluid solid
system is governed by first, an oscillator equation for the fluid sloshing motion, with an
excitation from the motion of the solid. Second, an oscillator equation for the solid motion with
an excitation by fluid sloshing. There is also the classical
added mass effect, which I have put on the left hand
side to focus just on the coupling terms. So what I get is coupled
sloshing solid dynamics. Actually, this is very similar
to a double mass-spring system, but here, one of the oscillator is solid and
the other is fluid. This is a classical case of mode coupling. What does the motion look like? Here we have integrated
the two equations in time, and what you see is that the motion of
the support affects sloshing. And that sloshing affects
the motion of the support [MUSIC]. This is a very important result. We obtained it on a simple geometry, but you can obtain similar
results in the general case. The key point is that the force feedback, in relation to the added mass effect, is
itself governed by a oscillator equation. So, the fluid here again
as an internal time scale, which is that other sloshing mode. This time is scaled by
the dynamic  Froude number. When we investigate
the effect of viscosity, we also add an internal time scale. It was that of viscous diffusion, and
it was scaled by the Stokes number. So, oscillation on one side,
diffusion on the other. These are the two main
mechanisms that may cause the feedback force from the fluid
to the solid to be delayed. What happens if the dynamics of the solid need to be approximated
by more than one mode? Well, all this is linear mechanics. So, we're going to have coupling
matrices in place of coupling coefficients and so on. But the root mechanisms
of coupling remain. What happens if the dynamics of the solid
needs to be approximated by more than one mode? Again we can extend all this easily and
the root mechanisms remain. What you see here corresponds
to large amplitude of course. And that's another story. But  the underlying mechanics is the same. Let us conclude on all these effects
of fluid-solid couplings at low reduced velocities We found that
the variety of coupling that  exists when the fluid is not moving by
itself is already quite large. Added mass, added damping,
added stiffness, memory effect, mode coupling. What is nice is that using the dimensionless
numbers, you know when you can find them, and what will be the effect
on the dynamics of the solid. A very good news also is that to obtain
the coefficients in the equations, like  the added mass, you only need to solve very
simple equations in the fluid domain. Once for all, and not at  every instant. And because these equations are so simple, the results exist already in plenty of
tables and graphs for many geometries. Again, no need of advanced
CFD to get these effects. Here are some of the examples I used
when we explore all these effects. As you can easily imagine,
reality in all these cases is more complex than the idealized
problems we solved together. But the important thing is that you know what is behind all the effects
that you may observe. And you know what to expect. Remember that we said that we could use dimensionless analysis to classify
problems and eventually build models. This is exactly what we
have been doing together. So far, we have explored the domain
of very low reduced velocities. This means when the dynamics of
the fluid is very slow compared to the dynamics of the solid. But there are plenty of things happening
at high reduced velocity when, conversely, the dynamics of
the fluid is much faster. For instance,
when wings start to vibrate in planes, or when bridges oscillate under wind. This is exactly what you shall explore
next: coupling with a fast flow. You will learn how to predict
things like wing flutter in planes. [MUSIC]
